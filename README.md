My professional coding portfolio.

#
## Project Overview:
This is my first attempt at a professional coding portfolio.  As I continue with coding bootcamp, I will continue to update and fine tune this website.  The goal is to showcase my skills to potential employers.

#
## Project Goals:
1. Include a picture and breif bio.
2. Showcase what I have learned using CSS and HTML.
3. Continue to improve the website as I learn more as the course continues.
